# Copilot Rules

## Documentation and Change Management

- Store any change logs, documents that summarize changes, or similar assets in the `/changelogs` folder so they don't get scattered throughout the repo
- Keep documentation files in a `/docs` folder to maintain organization and ease of access
- Keep primary source files in a `/src` folder to separate them from other types of files
- Keep spike or experimental projects in a `/spikes` folder
